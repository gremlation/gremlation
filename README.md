# Gremlation: a generalist developer

I have 25 years of experience doing all kinds of development. I'm currently focused on generative AI, and I work frequently with Stable Diffusion and ComfyUI.

I'm available for short-term and part-time contracts. If you need somebody to:

- Develop custom ComfyUI nodes
- Clean up or maintain existing nodes
- Fix bugs
- Build complex workflows
- Review your code
- Unfuck a mess
- Spend a day a week sorting your shit out

Send me an email `@proton.me` with the same username as here. Include a description of what you want, when you need it by, and what your budget is.
